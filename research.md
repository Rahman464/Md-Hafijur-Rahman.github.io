# Research

My research explores defect dynamics in advanced materials and semiconductor devices, particularly under radiation exposure and electropulsing-based annealing.

## Current Focus Areas:
- Electron Wind Force (EWF) based annealing of GaN and SiC devices
- Low-temperature defect recovery mechanisms
- Heavy-ion, gamma, and proton radiation effects
- In-situ TEM analysis during electropulsing
