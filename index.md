I am a materials scientist and researcher focused on developing low-temperature alternatives to conventional thermal annealing. My current research explores the use of Electron Wind Force (EWF) to recover radiation-induced defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors like GaN and SiC, as well as in structural alloys.  

My goal is to enable more energy-efficient, scalable approaches to defect engineering in next-generation electronic and structural systems. I am also actively engaged in in-situ characterization methods, including TEM, to visualize real-time defect dynamics during processing.
